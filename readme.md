## Usage

There are some environment variables that are expected.  Use `.env.example` to see what these are. Either ensure they are available or copy and complete into a `.env` file which will automatically be read.

## Other Teams

In theory, this chat bot can be re-purposed to work with other teams by instantiating rugbybot with one of the following team names:

- northampton saints
- exeter chiefs
- saracens
- bath rugby
- leicester tigers
- wasps
- sale sharks
- harlequins
- gloucester rugby
- newcastle falcons
- bristol rugby
- worcester warriors


## Production

This bot is running in production on IBM Bluemix and can be spoken to or invited to a telegram group chat. The username is "bathrugby_bot".

The first request may be slow as Drop22 is on a Heroku free dyno so will take a second to boot up.

## Development

### Testing

Mocha, Sinon and Chai are used to provide test coverage.

`npm tests`

To generate the HTML code coverage report in ./coverage, run:

`npm run coverage`

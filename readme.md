# Telegram Premiership Rugby Bot

This telegram chat bot will fetch results and fixture information for Premiership Rugby teams.

It uses [IBM Watson Conversation API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation.html) to understand intents and entities.

Defaults to Bath Rugby 🔵⚫️⚪️.

## Other Teams

- northampton saints
- exeter chiefs
- saracens
- bath rugby
- leicester tigers
- wasps
- sale sharks
- harlequins
- gloucester rugby
- newcastle falcons
